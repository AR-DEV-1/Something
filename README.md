# EaglercraftY (WIP)
This is a project based on LAX1DUDE's EaglercraftX project.
<br>
This time, this will actually be a decent project. Not a hoax, not a fake claim.
<br>
Source code will be developed by people other than the original creator.
<br>
Scheduled Release Date: Projected for the end of this year, but may release late.
<br>
This is currently a fork of EaglercraftX. Major changes will be planned.
